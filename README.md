# Sparse-System-Identification-in-Non-stationary-Environment.
System identification is an imperative assignment in numerous zones counting broadcast communications, control engineering, detecting, and acoustics. Adaptive filtering may be a well-known strategy for system identification. A framework with few non-zero coefficients is named a sparse system. When these few non-zero coefficients are changed its amplitude and position with regard to the time at that point non-stationary environment is introduced. To distinguish such sort of framework the convergence speed ought to be high with the least mean square error with greater tracking capability. So for recognizing a sparse system in a boisterous environment we require a versatile filtering plot with higher convergence speed and the least mean square error.
When we attempt to increase the convergence it yields a larger mean square error and on the off chance that we attempt to decrease the mean square error,  it'll diminish the convergence speed. System recognizable proof with quick filter increases convergence speed but a minimum mean square error cannot be guaranteed by it. On the other hand system identification with a slow filter diminishes the mean square mistake but cannot increase the convergence speed. So the trade-off between convergence speed and minimum mean square error ought to be required.
